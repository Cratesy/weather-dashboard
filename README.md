## description

we've been tasked with creating a weather app to call from multiple APi's to give current day weather and a 5 day forecast ive done;

- created html and used js to import files into the html
- Signed up for two weather API's to pull data from
- created a form to ask for input of city
- stored that city in local and pulled info out of API's
- displayed current day weather
- displayed a 5 day forecast
- used moment for converting the Epoch into current day

# todo

fix uvi to show coloured background for uvi risk
